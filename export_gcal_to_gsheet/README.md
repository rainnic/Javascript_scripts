# Export Google Calendar Events to a Google Spreadsheet

Original script written by Justin Gale, found in [Export Google Calendar Entries to a Google Spreadsheet](https://www.cloudbakers.com/blog/export-google-calendar-entries-to-a-google-spreadsheet)

The function **export_gcal_to_gsheet** retrieves events between 2 dates for the specified calendar.
It logs the results in the current spreadsheet starting at cell A3 listing the events, dates/times, etc and even calculates event duration (via creating formulas in the spreadsheet) and formats the values.

There are two version:

 1. Coge_en.gs (script in English);
 2. Code_it.gs (script in italiano).

## Coming soon
In the next weeks I am going to improve the script by adding new features, in particular the topics may be:

 - how to consider different type of shift depending on the label put in event title and sum it;
 - how to make a sum considering all the introduced variables above and an hourly pay rate;
 - how to add a pie chart that summarise all the data.
